# CyberLearning 

This repository is my personal learning space for cybersecurity.  
Here I practice and document different projects for a future SOC Analyst role.

## About

I use this repo to save all my exercises and notes while I learn cybersecurity tools and concepts.  
All projects are made with Python and open-source tools on Kali Linux.

## Projects included

- **Port Scanner** — A simple Python script to scan open ports on a target host.  
- **Honeypot Analysis** — A basic honeypot that simulates a fake server and logs connection attempts. Uses Python and Pandas to analyze the honeypot logs.  
- **Nmap Automation** — A script to automate Nmap scans and generate reports.  
- **SOC Workbook** — Contains practical notes, screenshots, and evidence from my labs.

## Skills developed

- Network scanning and reconnaissance  
- Log collection and analysis  
- Python automation  
- Basic SOC investigation process  
- Using Nmap, Wireshark, and tcpdump  

## Tools

- Python  
- Kali Linux  
- Nmap  
- Wireshark / tcpdump  

## Goal

This repository shows my progress as I learn and build a cybersecurity portfolio.  
All projects are simple but real and made step by step by me.
